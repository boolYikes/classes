### 🔴Sample and population
1. YAPYTAPYAPYAP
<hr>

### 💹Categorical Data, Numerical Data
1. Quantitative data : numerical
	- height, weight, num of voters, etc
2. Qualitative data : categorical
	- sex, job, etc
<hr>

### 💥Subject, Property, Variable
#### element, content, attribute in html!!
##### Independent variable
- Not affected by other variables, affects dependent vars.
- e.g., a subject house' square footage is not affected by 		 neibors.
- In the formula y=3x, x is independent from y.
- Equavelant to input values in dev env

##### Dependent variable
- Affected by independent vars
- e.g., a subject house' value is affected by its square footage.
- In the formula y=3x, y is dependent on x.
- Equavelant to outputs in dev env
<hr>

### 💫Frequency, relative frequency
- rf : f를 전체 수로 나눈거
- histogram

### 💔Box plot
- Quartiles visualization
- median(2nd quartile) = middle
- 1st quartile = 0.25
- 3rd quartile = 0.75
- max, min : DOES NOT INCLUDE OUTLIERS
- the box : 1~3rd quartile
- Interquartile range : 3rdQ - 1stQ
- Outlier : out of range of max and min
<hr>

### 💢NaN
- not null but wrong
<hr>

### 💟Mean integrity
- mean value alone is not meant to scale for data analysis
- hence the use of mode(most freq) and median
- and the emergence of :
<hr>

### 💤Deviation, varience, standard deviation
- dev: distances from observation to mean
- var: mean of devs squared (spread) - no more negatives!
- std: square root of var -> scale down the var to its original scale
<hr>

### 🧡Normal, standard normal distribution

### ♻Scattered plot
- visualizes correlation

### 💚Correlation coefficient
- determins if its negative, positive, curved, etc correlation.
- this being close to negative means negative correlation

### 💌AI and mathematics
- unnecessary!

### 🆑Calculus
- expresses an object's ever moving or changing motion
- descriptive of the moment of the motion
<hr>
